This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with an empty array.  The issue arises when attempting to find documents where a field is present and its value is within an empty array.  This query unexpectedly returns no results instead of the documents where the field exists, regardless of its value. The solution showcases how to use the `$exists` operator in conjunction with `$in` or an alternative approach to correctly retrieve documents.
